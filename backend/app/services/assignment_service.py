"""Assignment creation and lifecycle.

This is the concurrency-sensitive core of the backend: turning an
approved resource plan into real assignments must never let two requests
hand the same resource to two incidents. Safety here is layered, not relied
on from a single mechanism:

1. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the target incident, the authorizing
   recommendation and the resources, taken in a fixed order (incident,
   then recommendation, then resources sorted by id), so concurrent
   requests serialize instead of deadlocking each other.
2. Re-checking resource status *after* the lock is held, before writing
   anything.
3. The partial unique index on `assignments(resource_id) WHERE status IN
   (...)` (see the initial migration) as a database-level backstop that
   holds even if the above were ever bypassed — caught here and turned into
   a 409 instead of a raw 500.

All writes for one call (incident status, resource status(es), assignment
row(s), action log entries) happen in a single transaction: either all of it
commits, or none of it does.

POST /assignments is *not* a first-dispatch gate (Phase 4): every call must
reference the incident's current APPROVED recommendation, and every
requested resource must belong to it — an arbitrary decision_source like
"ai" no longer authorizes anything by itself. Real dispatch happens as part
of approving a recommendation (recommendation_service.approve_recommendation
creates the assignments directly, in the same transaction as the approval).
This endpoint's remaining role is a compatibility one — confirming/creating
an assignment for a resource that's genuinely part of an already-approved
plan, idempotently returning the existing live assignment for a pair that's
already been dispatched, per INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md's createAssignment.
