"""Disruptions: n8n reporting that a dispatched responder is obstructed.

This only records the fact — the incident moves to the `blocked` phase and
the affected assignment's ETA is revised (keeping the previous value). The
obstructed resource stays DISPATCHED: releasing it is part of approving a
replacement plan (recommendation_service), never a side effect of the report
itself. The backend doesn't decide *that* a road is blocked or compute any
ETA; both arrive in the payload.
