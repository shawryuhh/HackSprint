"""Shared helper for writing audit entries.

Every state-changing service function calls `record_action` as part of its
own transaction — logging is baked into the write path, not left as an
optional step for callers to remember. This function only adds to the
session; the caller's transaction commit persists it alongside the state
change it documents.
