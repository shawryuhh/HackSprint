"""Test isolation.

Tests must never write to the development database. Instead of switching to
SQLite (which can't exercise the Postgres-specific locking behavior the
assignment service relies on), we point the app at a second, disposable
database on the *same* Postgres container/instance: `reliefmesh_test` by
default, or whatever `TEST_DATABASE_URL` says.

This has to happen before `app.db.session` is imported anywhere, since that
module builds its engine from settings at import time. Setting the
environment variable here, at the very top of conftest.py (which pytest
always imports before any test module), is enough — pydantic-settings
prefers real environment variables over the `.env` file.
